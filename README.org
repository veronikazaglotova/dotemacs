* How to install:
  Run =git clone https://github.com/veronikazaglotova/dotemacs ~/.emacs.d= in your terminal window.

* How to use:
  Read the source code and figure it out. There are docstrings and/or comments for every non-trivial task.
  You can still read the source code if you're not a programmer. I'm not a programmer, but I can configure Emacs, so (most likely) you can do it too.
